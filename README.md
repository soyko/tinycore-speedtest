# tinycore-speedtest
Speedtest.net setup in base TinyCore

There are times when I need to do something inside of a base tinycore instance for work where I don't have speedtest available.
I'm told to user iperf, but it's not the best.

Made this so I can just have a one stop shop to use this as needed.
